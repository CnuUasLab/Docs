This is the official GitHub organization for the Christopher Newport Unmanned Aerial Systems Lab

This is the repo of all the documents related to the lab's research.

The CNU UAS Lab develop autonomous quadcopters, planes, and helicopters.  The lab's research includes work with systems integration and development.  Current research and development projects include custom ArduPilot code, antenna tracker systems, 802.11 long rang networks, meshnets, and aerial image processing.

Some of this research is for the 2014 AUVSI SUAS competition.  2014 is the team's first year in the competition, but they are expected to place well.
